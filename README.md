This code was presented in the IBM Cognitive Watson IOT hackathon conducted at persistent's workplaces in bengaluru 2017 and won the Winner's prize. the app is a simple proof of concept demonstrating a live map with markers in bengaluru showing bikes, which can be then clicked and a sample dock detail will be shown.
When the user starts the ride, Ride details are shown and money is managed through a sample wallet.
